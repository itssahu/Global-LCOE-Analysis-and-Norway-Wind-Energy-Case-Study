# **Global LCOE Analysis and Norway Wind Energy Case Study**

## **Introduction**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)** for wind onshore and wind offshore technologies using data from the **World Bank’s LCOE database**. The study also includes a specific **case study on Norway**, assessing the impact of national policies on wind energy costs. The project aligns with global LCOE data processing, policy research, and visualization requirements.

## **2. Key Findings from LCOE Analysis for Wind Onshore and Offshore**

### **LCOE Comparison (Boxplot Analysis)**
- **Onshore wind has a lower and stable LCOE**, making it more cost-competitive.
- **Offshore wind shows greater cost variability**, with some cases exceeding **$250/MWh**.

### **Impact of CAPEX on LCOE (Scatter Plot)**
- **Higher CAPEX leads to higher LCOE**, particularly for offshore wind with costs ranging from **$4000–$5000/kW**.
- **Onshore wind maintains LCOE below $100/MWh**, proving its cost efficiency.

### **Impact of Capacity Factor on LCOE**
- **Higher capacity factors improve LCOE efficiency but do not fully offset offshore wind costs**.
- **Onshore wind remains viable even at lower capacity factors (25–30%)**.

### **Impact of Discount Rate on LCOE**
- **LCOE increases with rising discount rates**, affecting offshore wind more severely.
- **Low-interest financing could help reduce LCOE for offshore wind projects**.

### **Impact of Economic Life on LCOE**
- **Longer project lifespans reduce LCOE**, benefiting both technologies.
- **Offshore wind remains expensive despite extended operational life**.

### **Impact of Fixed O&M Costs on LCOE**
- **Higher maintenance costs significantly increase offshore wind LCOE**, making cost reductions in O&M critical.
- **Onshore wind has a lower O&M burden, contributing to its lower LCOE**.

## **3. Case Study: Norway Wind Energy Policy and LCOE Impact**

### **Current State of Wind Energy in Norway**
- **Total wind capacity:** 5,130 MW (101 MW offshore).
- **Government support:** 35 billion NOK ($3.3B) in subsidies for offshore wind.
- **Taxation policy:** 25% resource rent tax on onshore wind (introduced in 2024).
- **Carbon pricing:** Norway participates in the **EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)**.

### **LCOE Before and After Norway-Specific Adjustments**
- **Onshore wind LCOE rose from $60–70/MWh to $120–180/MWh** due to taxation.
- **Offshore wind expected LCOE reductions but instead increased to $250–350/MWh** due to high O&M costs.
- **Deep-water offshore wind projects face the highest LCOE values, exceeding $600/MWh**.

### **Key Policy Issues Impacting LCOE in Norway**
- **High Taxation on Onshore Wind:** 25% resource rent tax discourages investments.
- **Offshore Wind Subsidies Are Not Effective:** CAPEX-focused subsidies fail to address O&M costs.
- **Grid Limitations:** Offshore wind integration faces high transmission costs.
- **Land Conflicts:** Indigenous Sami communities have opposed wind projects, causing legal delays.
- **Floating Wind Technology Challenges:** Limited large-scale deployment keeps LCOE high.

### **Recommendations for Reducing LCOE in Norway**
- **Reform Onshore Wind Taxation:** Reduce the 25% tax to restore cost-competitiveness.
- **Subsidize O&M for Offshore Wind:** Shift subsidies from CAPEX to maintenance cost reduction.
- **Expand Grid Infrastructure:** Develop offshore energy hubs and HVDC transmission lines.
- **Ensure Land Use Fairness:** Implement profit-sharing and consultation policies with indigenous groups.
- **Invest in Floating Wind R&D:** Support large-scale trials to reduce technological costs.
